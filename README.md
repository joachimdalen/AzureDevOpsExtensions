# 📦 Azure DevOps Extensions

For the time being my extensions published under the publisher [JoachimDalen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/joachimdalen) is closed source, with a goal to open source them in the end.

This repository serves as a public feature and issue tracker for these extensions.

## Status on open sourcing

I decided to prioritize refacotoring, cleanup, documentation and test improvements before open sourcing the extensions listed above. Currently I do not have a timeframe for this, but it is in progress. 

These things could be done while it is open source, but most of the extensions were thrown together in a hurry because I needed them there and then. At the current state, they do not represent how I like to present my code and that I want to fix before releasing the source.

This issue tracker will be migrated to individual repositories under the organization [DevOps Extensions](https://github.com/devops-extensions) when ready.
